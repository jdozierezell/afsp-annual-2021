<h2>Advocating for Suicide Prevention</h2>

<p>Each year, AFSP’s Public Policy team mobilizes energetic volunteer Field Advocates across the country to urge public officials to prioritize suicide prevention and mental health. Together, we make bold strides at the federal, state, and local levels to pass suicide prevention policies that can save lives.</p> 
<p>Our efforts this fiscal year resulted in the successful passage of six federal bills and 43 state bills that will make a difference in how we as a nation combat this leading cause of death.</p>

<h3>Federal Advocacy for Suicide Prevention</h3>
<p>AFSP continues to be at the forefront of the movement to make crisis services more accessible across the U.S. This past year, AFSP played a leading role in the supporting passage of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act (S.2661), which designated 988 as the future universal phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. From meeting with members of Congress and federal agencies behind the scenes, to leading coalition activities and facilitating discussions with the telecom industry, AFSP ensured that S.2661 was a top priority for federal decision makers in 2020.</p>
<p>AFSP’s volunteer Field Advocates joined together with mental health and suicide prevention organizations across the U.S. in a Day of Action to urge Congress to move S.2661 forward. Our advocates sent 1,886 emails to members of Congress and 1,310 letters to media outlets across the country, demonstrating widespread public support for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s transition to 988 and influencing the unanimous passage of the bill before it was signed into law by the President in October.</p>
<p>AFSP also advocated for vital increases in federal suicide prevention funding during the Fiscal Year 2021 Appropriations Process and through COVID-19 relief funding. Many of these increases were ultimately passed, including: </p>

<ul>
<li>  $24 million for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ($5 million increase over FY 20)</li>
<li>  $12 million for suicide prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ($2 million increase over FY 20)</li>
<li>  $9 million for the Garrett Lee Smith Suicide Prevention Resource Center ($1.02 million increase over FY 20)</li>
<li>  Increased funding to the National Institute of Mental Health for research </li>
<li>  Inclusion of suicide prevention for the first time as a research topic in the Department of Defense’s Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program</li>
<li>  Funding for community-based mobile crisis intervention services through Medicaid, and youth suicide prevention programs at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration through the American Rescue Plan</li>
</ul>

<h3>Annual Advocacy Forum</h3>
<p>The 12th Annual Advocacy Forum was held in June 2021, reaching over 10K people via Facebook Live. This year’s event featured 14 content experts including those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Defense, National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. Virtual attendees were educated on 10+ policy areas including federal funding for suicide prevention research; 988 and the continuum of crisis care; bridge barriers; suicide prevention in health systems; and tele-mental health. </p>
<p>Following the virtual presentation, AFSP’s volunteer advocates across all 50 states and D.C. met online or over the phone with over 200 members of Congress to urge support for AFSP’s top federal priorities. </p>

<h3>State Advocacy for Suicide Prevention</h3>
<p>Our advocacy for 988 and crisis services continued into 2021 on the state level, as every AFSP chapter across the country supported efforts to fund 988 and local crisis call centers as part of their State Capitol Day event. Together, our state efforts reached all corners of the country, with a State Capitol Day held in all 50 states and D.C., including three first-time events in Hawaii, Nevada, and Washington. Thousands of advocates participated in these events virtually, meeting with state public officials in support of 174 state bills in AFSP priority areas. Over 30 of these bills were signed into law by June 30, 2021. Some highlights include:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wisconsin extended workers’ compensation benefits to first responders suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</li>
<li>  Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah established programs to provide first responders with access to crisis services, peer support, and/or treatment for mental health conditions</li>
<li>  Arkansas, Maryland, South Carolina, and Texas enacted requirements for school districts and colleges/universities to include suicide prevention hotline information on all student ID cards</li>
<li>  Oklahoma now requires that all school districts adopt suicide awareness and prevention policies and provide suicide awareness and prevention training to staff every 2 years</li>
<li>  Colorado, Nevada, Virginia, and Washington put telecom user fees in place to fund 988 the same way as 911 and support local crisis call centers and response services</li>
<li>  Oregon now requires mental health providers to complete regular suicide risk assessment, treatment, and management training</li>
<li>  Missouri now requires health benefit plans that provide coverage for mental health conditions to meet the requirements and regulations of the federal Mental Health Parity law</li>
</ul>

<p class="stats_highlight">In total, from July 1, 2020 – June 30, 2021, AFSP volunteer Field Advocates created awareness and action regarding suicide prevention and mental health across the country, sending:</p>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">You have attended six Advocacy Forums. What is advocacy, and what does it mean to advocate for suicide prevention? </p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">Advocacy means asking your representatives for their support of legislation that relates to a cause you believe is important, like suicide prevention. AFSP’s annual Advocacy Forum is a great way to gain knowledge of any new or current legislation we want to push for, meet other volunteer Field Advocates across the nation just like you, and discover what has or has not worked for them in their own districts. You also get tips on how to speak with a representative regarding the purpose of your visit. AFSP’s Policy Team sets all the volunteers up for success.</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">What kind of legislation do you personally think is important?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">As an Army veteran, knowing that AFSP supports legislation that makes suicide prevention a priority for Veterans, Servicemembers, and their families is very important to me. The military trains you to &#8220;suck it up,&#8221; and the silent struggles are often ignored. This atmosphere doesn’t go away when you transition back into the civilian world. No one understands what you have witnessed, felt, or were subjected to. It’s hard to explain to your loved ones, and it’s even harder for them to understand how to help you when you are trapped in your own mental turmoil. Knowing that AFSP is fighting for me, for my fellow active duty Servicemembers and our families, gives me hope that change will come, and more Veterans will see that asking for help is the exact opposite of weakness. It is actually a strength.</p>

<p class="modalspotlight_question">What does the phrase #MentalHealth4All mean to you?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I lost my beautiful mom at the young age of 50 in 2011. She had battled depression since she was in her teens. #MentalHealth4All means changing things for future generations. I have been open with my daughters since day one of losing my mom, their &#8220;nanna Di.&#8221; I have shown them compassion and empathy through my involvement with AFSP, taught them the warning signs, and let them know, &#8220;It’s okay not to be okay.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I brought my two older daughters along with me to meetings on &#8220;The Hill&#8221; during past Advocacy Forums. My hope is that they will be even better advocates than I am. Throughout my AFSP journey, they have witnessed how impactful just one voice can be. They know their voice is powerful. If our representatives see the need, they will listen. Every voice is loud, but together we are LOUDER! </p>

<p>As an Army veteran, knowing that AFSP supports legislation that makes suicide prevention <strong>a priority</strong> for Veterans, Servicemembers, and their families is very important to me.</p>

<p class="modalspotlight_question">What personally inspires you and your family in the fight to #StopSuicide?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">When our 15-year-old daughter, Nina, died by suicide in September 2016, my wife Dawn and I could have hidden the cause of her death and remained silent. Instead, we chose to bring our story out of the darkness to help others. We are now focused on changing our culture so mental illness is treated with the same care and respect as physical illness. We do this to help others, and to honor Nina and the wonderful 15 years she gave to everyone whose lives she touched.</p>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">How have you and your family been involved in suicide prevention advocacy? </p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I have served on the board of directors of the Washington State Chapter since 2018, and currently lead our chapter’s advocacy efforts. Advocacy is a simple way for us to make a difference by supporting changes to laws (and pushing for new ones) that will bring mental health and suicide prevention into our regular conversations and help save lives. I could see the power of advocacy after attending AFSP’s annual Advocacy Forum in 2019. This year, I led the first-ever State Capitol Week event in Washington state, where we held a virtual kick-off event on State Capitol Day to educate our volunteer advocates on the policies that need support in their state, and give them the opportunity to hear from and speak to local legislators. This was followed throughout the week with Zoom meetings, phone calls, and e-mails to members of the state legislature. AFSP’s National Policy Team, along with the support of other volunteer Field Advocates like myself across the country, were instrumental in passing a bill which will fund 988, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and our local crisis call centers the same way as the 911 number. This critical piece of legislation was signed by the governor in May.</p>

<p class="modalspotlight_question">What does the phrase #MentalHealth4All mean to you?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I hope to see a world where mental health is treated the same as physical health, with science-based treatment options, and educational programs that give children the coping tools they need at that young age, and that they will continue to use throughout their lives. It’s important that we ensure our schools have the training and resources to support this. I also know how powerful it can be to advocate for legislation that addresses the disparity in mental healthcare access for underrepresented communities. </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">We are focused on honoring Nina’s legacy, and I can’t imagine a better way to do so than to bring suicide prevention out of the darkness.</p>
