<h2>The Out of the Darkness Walks</h2>

<p>When AFSP’s Out of the Darkness Walks first started in 2002, organizers wondered whether people would be willing to walk openly through the streets of their towns or cities to raise awareness for suicide in the same way they would for other leading causes of death.  </p>
<p>The answer was a resounding “Yes!” Suicide is an issue that affects people everywhere. For the last 19 years, individuals in communities across the country have been willing to show up, and send the message that no one has to be alone – and that if we join together, our collective voices can truly make a difference.  </p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has raised perhaps the greatest challenge to the Walks since they began. Suicide prevention is especially critical during this challenging time. Could events that seemingly drew so much of their power by bringing people physically together continue when so much has shifted online due to safety concerns? </p> 
<p>Miraculously, in a tribute to the steadfastness and resilience of our Walks family, our staff, volunteers and supporters rose to the challenge. Now more than ever, we are #TogetherToFightSuicide.  </p>
<p>AFSP’s Community, Campus, and Overnight Walks continued this past year, providing one of the most inspiring moments in the history of these important events. </p>

<h3>Bringing Communities Out of the Darkness</h3>
<p>The Community Walks, held in hundreds of cities across the country, are the core of the Out of the Darkness movement, with friends, family members, neighbors and coworkers walking side-by-side, supporting each other and in memory of those we’ve lost.</p>
<p>In the midst of unprecedented challenges – from physical safety issues, to burnout, to limited funding and the many complexities that arose during a global pandemic – AFSP staff and the Walks community found creative and resourceful ways to keep these inspiring events going: mastering new platforms to stream live events and hosting recorded Walk programs, raising interest and keeping participants engaged and motivated, and continuing to attract sponsorships and much-needed funds when resources are tight for potential partners. </p>
<p>Walks transformed into powerful, active virtual “Experiences,” supported by safe, in-person engagements throughout the season to foster an even stronger connection among our participants than ever before. </p>
<p>We’d like to give thanks to our national sponsor, The Allergan Foundation, for its continued support of the Community Walks this year.</p>

<h3>Bringing Campuses Out of the Darkness</h3>
<p>Young people represent the future of how our society understands and supports mental health. Teens, young adults, faculty and family members come together each spring to participate in AFSP Campus Walks at high schools, colleges and universities across the country. </p>
<p>School was different this year for so many – yet there was never any doubt that creative and dedicated students would rise to the occasion, spreading the message among their peers that suicide is something that must be faced together, with help and support available to anyone who needs it.</p> 
<p>With only a few traditional, in-person events taking place in physically safe ways, most Campus Walks this year went virtual. Nevertheless, our young Walkers and their supporters came through, staying engaged in clever ways, including a Campus Day of Action on April 24, with 38 events taking place and students sharing and posting their unique activities to spread hope and awareness of suicide prevention.</p>

<h3>The Overnight</h3>
<p>AFSP&#8217;s flagship fundraising event, The Overnight, traditionally brings thousands of people together to walk 16 miles from dusk to dawn in solidarity for this important, deeply personal cause. The connections people make last a lifetime, and the funds they raise save lives. It is an event that is powered by love, support, hugs and togetherness. </p>
<p>Pivoting once again this year to a virtual event due to the pandemic, the 2021 Overnight was a rousing success. Inspired and engaged, participants built their excitement leading up to the main Overnight Virtual Experience event by pledging to take #OvernightAction such as walking, running, journaling, bicycling, reading, yoga, and more to engage their friends and followers. Our Walkers stayed connected to each other along the way through a new, private Facebook Group, where they shared stories of hope and connection with each other. </p>
<p>Throughout June, we encouraged this year’s Overnight participants to truly “walk” virtually, through the innovative MoveSpring app, which recreated a traditional Overnight route using a custom map of New York City, allowing Walkers to move through Rest Stops, Midnight Snack, Cheering Stations and special Mindful Moments along the route, unlocking milestones as they completed their walk. Participants were able to communicate and chat with one another, sharing photos and stories, and supporting each other. </p>
<p>A special Overnight Virtual Experience event program was held on June 26, featuring inspiring speeches, discussions, and videos about why the cause is so important, and keeping us all going until next year’s event, when we hope to gather in person once again.</p>
<p>We wish to thank this year’s Overnight sponsor, Sunovion, for making this important event possible.</p>

<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I have a double dose of connectivity to mental health and suicide. My younger brother Atif died from suicide on August 31, 2007, and I have personally battled depression and thoughts of suicide several times since his death.  </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">When my brother died, my main desire every day was to wake up to a different world: one in which Atif was still alive. Even though his death was felt by each of his friends and my family, the loss impacted each of us in different ways. My mother lost a son, and I lost a brother. A special community surrounded his life, and we became a community seeking to move forward after his death.</p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I learned about the Philadelphia Walk, and formed a small team in memory of my brother. There were so many people walking in the same direction towards the Art Museum, many of whom, like us, were wearing garments honoring their lost loved ones. It was the first time I felt I was around people who could truly relate to my own experience. I could sense purpose in the air, and I could feel the love. There was a lot of smiling, some crying. Each part was necessary.</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">How have the Walks continued to be a part of your life?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">The healing process for me includes the Walk here in Philadelphia each October. Thanksgiving and Christmas can be difficult moments when our loved ones aren’t alive to celebrate with us. So the Walk can be very encouraging prior to that time of year.</p>  
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">Because of the Walk, the Art Museum and the trails surrounding the area have become a safe space for me to visit year-round. It’s a necessary step in a lifelong journey of healing.  </p>
</div>


<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">How has your connection with AFSP grown? </p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">Through my experience with the Walk, I have found a powerful connection with this organization. I am a spoken word artist and songwriter, and when I was putting together an arts event in memory of Atif, the Philadelphia Area Director and other board members supported me with resources, and eventually encouraged me to join the Philadelphia Chapter as a board member. In January 2021 that became a reality.</p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">Over the last few years I’ve learned how to take better care of my own mental health through therapy, journaling, going for walks, and sharing my story with others. The healing process has been an uphill climb, but it’s been so worth it. Sharing my story while still healing, myself, is a way of bringing truth to the surface.</p>

<p class="modalspotlight_question">What does the phrase #MentalHealth4All mean to you?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">Maya Angelou once said in a poem: “We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.” That’s so true and beautiful.   </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">When I envision my hope for the future, stigma around mental health will be a thing of the past. Fathers and mothers will heal properly from trauma, and teach children how to take care of their mental health at very young ages.  </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I plan to participate in the healing of our world by being transparent, and teaching others what I’ve learned through my times of struggle and triumph. I plan to change the world by loving my family properly and teaching my own children and other people in my community how to find hope.  </p>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">How and why did you first get connected to AFSP?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I lost my son Geoff in 2000, over 20 years ago. Ten years after his death, I was introduced to AFSP by volunteering with my daughter for an Out of the Darkness Community Walk. I found out there were people trying to form a chapter in Orange County. I met up with them and began my journey with AFSP. I was part of the founding board and am now the chapter chair.</p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">When my son died, I didn’t know about the risk factors and warning signs. I often wonder how my life could have been different if only I had known. At some point, I decided I had to turn Geoff’s death into a positive. The best I can do is to help educate the public so that other families don’t experience the pain I did when I lost my son. </p>
</div>


<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">What does The Overnight mean to you?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">The Overnight is such a profound event. The idea of walking in the dark of night and emerging into the sunrise is truly inspiring. Like all the walks, it gives people a chance to meet other people affected by suicide, and have the opportunity to support one another.</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">How was this year’s event different because of the pandemic?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">At first, I was hesitant about not being able to walk with other people as we normally do. But my Overnight Experience was amazing! Here it was 20 years since Geoff’s death, and this was by far the most meaningful and healing event I have participated in. </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">Since we were still unable to gather en masse because of COVID, I created my own special route in memory of Geoff. I got up on Saturday morning and walked to the cemetery where Geoff is buried, and spent a little time there. I then walked past the schools he attended – grammar, middle and high schools. Then I headed home by way of our favorite place to eat – the local Jack-in-the-Box – and got a chicken fajita pita in his memory. They were our fav. </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">The total route took me about 3 hours and 15 minutes. I got home refreshed and feeling really good. While I look forward to the time when we can all walk together again, this year I was able to think and share my thoughts just with him. It was more comforting and healing than I expected. </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I have a favorite quote about grief: “You just keep living until you are alive again.” On that day, I truly felt alive after my walk.</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">What does the phrase #MentalHealth4All mean to you?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I would like to see a world without suicide, in which everyone takes care of their mental health, and all people support one another and are kind to each other. Everyone should have access to the mental health support and services that they need. And everyone should know how to reach out and help those who are struggling.</p>
