<h2>Much of what is known about suicide comes from studies that AFSP has funded. Our studies open up new areas of inquiry, and our council of scientific advisors helps set the national research agenda.</h2>

<p>In addition to addressing the research priorities identified by the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, our 2021 Grants cover one or more of the following six content categories:</p>

<ul class="grants_intro-list">
<li class="grants_n"><strong>Neurobiological</strong>  How do brain structure and neurochemical function contribute to suicide?</li>
<li class="grants_p"><strong>Psychosocial</strong>  What are the risk factors and warning signs for suicide?</li>
<li class="grants_g"><strong>Genetic</strong>  What genetic pathways are associated with suicide risk, and can we develop biological interventions and treatments?</li>
<li class="grants_t"><strong>Treatment</strong>  What treatments — like therapies and medications — are effective at reducing suicide?</li>
<li class="grants_c"><strong>Community</strong>  What universal prevention programs — like hotlines, gatekeeper training, and community-based programs — are the most effective?</li>

<ul>
<li>$1,338,411</li>
<li>Grant Type: Short Term Risk Focus Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: T</li>
</ul>
<p>Ketamine rapidly decreases depression and suicidal ideation. However, its effects on suicidal behaviors are unclear. Patients admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideation and behavior are at high risk for attempting suicide after discharge. This study will investigate the effectiveness of maintenance treatment with intravenous ketamine for 6 months. Outcomes will be compared with standard care for patients admitted to inpatient units for suicidal ideation and behavior and with a historical comparison group with no suicidal ideation or behavior.</p>

<li>Research Area: N,P</li>
</ul>
<p>Little is known about the daily social interactions that children have that might increase risk or protect from suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). In a group of children who expressed suicidal thoughts and behaviors in early childhood, we will study cell phone communications and activity patterns to investigate if, and how, they might be related to expressions of STB. We will also explore whether exposure to certain types of media impacts these mental states. </p>

<ul>
<li>$446,999</li>
<li>Grant Type: Linked Standard Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: P</li>
</ul>
<p>Pregnancy and motherhood are often viewed as protective factors against self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. However, suicide accounts for 20-30% of perinatal deaths the year after birth. We will interview women who experience suicidal ideation during the 3rd trimester and then again at 6 weeks and 4 months postpartum. We will learn about suicidal thoughts or experiences and about risk and protective factors during the transition to motherhood.</p>

<ul>
<li>$99,712</li>
<li>Grant Type: Standard Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: G</li>
</ul>
<p>Genes play a role in how one manages stress and may relate to suicidal ideation and behavior. This study will investigate molecular mechanisms that mediate the effect of stress exposure in contributing to suicidal ideation in patients with schizophrenia. The main outcome of this grant would be to learn about the molecular mechanisms that link stress to suicidal ideation. 
Our proposed study will highlight novel and potentially treatable molecular targets for the treatment of suicidal ideation in people with schizophrenia.</p>

<ul>
<li>$99,024</li>
<li>Grant Type: Standard Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: N</li>
</ul>
<p>Brain regions that are sensitive to stress—and regulate physiological responses to stress—are implicated in suicide behavior. In bipolar disorder, greater sensitivity to stress and changes in brain regions that underlie stress response emerge over adolescence. How the brain responds to stress could contribute to risk for suicidal thoughts and behavior. This study investigates neurophysiological responses to stress as a risk factor for suicide in youth with bipolar disorder to inform suicide prevention efforts. </p>

</ul>
<p>Access to firearms increases risk of death by suicide, yet little is known about how voluntary divestment from firearms may reduce suicide risk. Building upon prior work supported by AFSP examining how personal divestment affects handgun owners’ own risk, the goal in this study is to learn more about how divestment may also affect the suicide risk for other household members, beyond gun owners.</p>

</ul>
<p>Suicide is the leading cause of death for women during pregnancy and in the first year postpartum. Using data from a population of women enrolled in Oregon Medicaid for low-income families and individuals with disabilities, we plan to investigate the impact of perinatal opioid use on suicide attempt and death. We also examine whether a unique value-based health care system implemented in Oregon Medicaid, known as Coordinated Care Organizations, may contribute to preventing maternal opioid misuse and suicide attempt and death. </p>

<h3>Mindful Self-Compassion to Reduce Suicide Ideation in Transgender Adolescents</h3>
<ul>
<li>$98,857</li>
<li>Grant Type: Standard Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: T</li>
</ul>
<p>Transgender teens are at heightened risk for suicide ideation. Self-compassion, linked to lower depression and anxiety, can be cultivated through interventions that teach teens skills to treat themselves with greater kindness and acceptance. This study will test the feasibility of an online self-compassion program tailored to the unique needs of transgender adolescents that is targeted to reduce suicide ideation. We will also explore whether specific transgender characteristics, such as being transmale, transfemale, or non-binary, influence outcomes.</p>

<p>Although low- and middle-income countries account for much of the global suicide burden, factors linked with suicidal ideation and behavior are understudied in these countries. The aim of this project is to identify factors that increase or reduce the association between adversity and suicidal ideation and behavior by studying a cohort of Brazilians followed since their birth in 1993. This research will help identify potential interventions based on modifiable factors associated with reduction of suicidal ideation and behavior appropriate for a lower-income setting. </p>

This project will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a brain imaging technique, to measure brain chemicals that excite and inhibit other neurotransmitters in
youth with and without suicidal behavior. We will also examine
how differences in brain chemistry correspond to the strength of
adolescents’ implicit thoughts about death and suicide.</p>

<h3>The Pattern and Risk Factors for Suicide Ideation
Among In-School Adolescents in Nigeria</h3>
<ul>
<li>$15,000 </li>
<li>Grant Type: Pilot Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: P</li>
</ul>
<p>Adolescent suicidal ideation, though prevalent in low and middleincome
countries (LMICs), is grossly under-researched. This study
will identify and compare psychometric properties such as the
reliability and validity of suicidal ideation tools to promote more
accurate identification of suicidal thoughts in non-clinical contexts.
The research seeks to clarify the risk factors, while investigating
factors that could be protective in a holistic manner. These data are
essential to provide evidence for awareness creation, advocacy,
policy, planning, and implantation of interventions.</p>

<h3>Suicide Risk and Protective Factors Among
Black Marylanders</h3>
<ul>
<li>$29,983</li>
<li>Grant Type: Pilot Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: P</li>
</ul>
<p>Suicide is a leading cause of death among Black Americans.
This study explores suicide risk and protective factors among
Black Marylanders. We will explore individual, family, and
community differences between Black suicide decedents and
White suicide decedents and Black Marylanders who died by
other manners. We will also explore the association between
historical events (the killing of Freddie Gray, the COVID-19
pandemic, and the 2020 racial injustice protests) and suicide
rates among Black Marylanders.</p>

<h3>Personalizing Nudges: Towards Precision Messaging for Suicide Prevention</h3>
<ul>
<li>$29,384</li>
<li>Grant Type: Pilot Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: T</li>
</ul>
<p>Nudges are behavioral economic interventions used in marketing to subtly alter decision-making environments to use mental shortcuts and ultimately influence behaviors without restricting autonomy. However, certain nudges work better for different people, and using nudges that work best for the majority excludes underrepresented populations. This study examines if tailoring mental health nudges by identifying specific groups from the data increases engagement with crisis resources on popular social media platforms. Further, this study will produce cost-benefit estimates for using personalized nudges versus a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

<h3>Telehealth-Delivered Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Prevent Suicides in People with
Physical Disabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>$30,000</li>
<li>Grant Type: Pilot Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: T</li>
</ul>
<p>People with physical disabilities report higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts when compared to the general population. However, no current interventions for suicide prevention are specifically designed to address the psychosocial and access needs of this population. The effectiveness of telehealth-administered Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Suicide Prevention, adapted for people with physical disabilities (BCBT-PWD), will be evaluated, and stakeholder feedback will be used to improve the accessibility and content of the intervention.</p>

<h3>Predicting Suicide and Self-Harm Risk in Linked Administrative Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>$30,000</li>
<li>Grant Type: Pilot Research Grant</li>
<li>Research Area: P</li>
</ul>
<p>Many individuals who attempt suicide have received a mental-health diagnosis, obtained treatment, appeared in emergency rooms, or received prior clinical care for other types of self-harm behavior. These are crucial prevention opportunities, but it is difficult to accurately predict suicide risk using traditional clinical methods. To improve assessment of risk for suicide attempt and self-harm, statistical computational-modeling approaches will be applied to a broad range of health and social variables obtained from nationwide, linked administrative records.</p>
