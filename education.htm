<h2>Creating a Safer World Through Education </h2>

<p>AFSP’s prevention education and partnership programs, delivered by our local chapters throughout the country, inform people everywhere – families, friends, neighbors, and coworkers – of what they can do to make a difference in their communities. Building on what we’ve learned from research, and using the latest data, AFSP’s evidence-informed education programs give a clear understanding of what leads someone to consider suicide, providing participants with practical knowledge of how to spot the warning signs, talk safely and compassionately to those they care about, connect people to help and resources, and support at-risk individuals following an attempt. </p>
<p>This year, as the pandemic continued, AFSP created specialized virtual presentations, as well as made education programs like Talk Saves Lives, More Than Sad, and It’s Real available virtually. By providing these and other AFSP signature education programs, 1,300 presentations were delivered virtually reaching 30,000. In this way, we continued to provide life-saving information to individuals and groups throughout the country, in support of #MentalHealth4All. </p>
<p>Through this experience, and what we learn through innovative new ways of reaching people everywhere, our educational initiatives will continue to evolve and become stronger than ever going forward. </p>

<h3>Talk Saves Lives&#8482;</h3>
<p>Our signature education program, <em>Talk Saves Lives: An Introduction to Suicide Prevention</em>, covers the general scope of suicide, providing participants with a clear understanding of this leading cause of death, including the most up-to-date research and data on suicide prevention. Participants gain an understanding of the health, historical, and environmental factors that put individuals at risk, as well as guidance on behaviors to look for, and how to get help for someone in a suicidal crisis. The program also enlightens people to the protective factors known to proactively lower suicide risk. </p>
<p><em>Talk Saves Lives</em> reaches a wide range of audiences, with specialized modules that have been created for particular segments of the population, including older adults, workplace settings, firearms retailers and range owners, and LGBTQ audiences. The standard presentation is also available in Spanish. </p>
<p>Since its launch in 2015, <em>Talk Saves Lives</em> has reached over 175,000 people across the country. </p>
<p>As the pandemic continued, AFSP adapted this important program to a virtual setting reaching over 24,000 participants. </p>

<h3>New Programs Created During the Pandemic</h3>

<h4>Enhancing Mental Health During Covid</h4>
<p>Our new program, <em>Enhancing Mental Health During Covid</em>, created specifically to reach audiences during this unprecedented time, provides a personalized introduction to AFSP as an organization, and lets people know how to best make use of the programming and resources made possible by their local AFSP chapter.</p> 
<p>Designed for general audiences and those age 15 and up, and available in both English and Spanish, the program meets people where they are today, showing them how they can put a focus on their own mental health, and support those they care about. The presentation includes practical self-care tips, and helpful resources we can all use as we take our mental health seriously and get through the pandemic, together. </p>

<h4>Introduction to Supporting Those At Risk</h4>
<p>When someone attempts suicide or experiences suicidal thoughts, it can be difficult to know how to best support them in their recovery. It is absolutely vital that we educate and provide support to those who are caring for someone at risk. </p>
<p>Developed to address this important topic, particularly during the pandemic when a virtual program was needed, <em>Introduction to Supporting Those At Risk</em> shares information with family members, friends and others on how to provide support to those with lived experience. The program covers: </p>

<ul>
<li>   understanding behaviors and experiences related to suicide</li>   
<li>   the recovery process for someone following a suicide attempt</li>   
<li>   strategies for supporting a loved one’s recovery</li>   
<li>   the importance of self-care for oneself, when supporting someone else</li>   
</ul>

<h4 class="lastsubhead">It’s Real: Teens and Mental Health</h4>

<p>Teens experience a number of factors related to mental health as they develop into adults. The new program <em>It’s Real: Teens and Mental Health</em> – designed for high school students ages 14 or older – takes these considerations into account, as participants learn how best to care for their own mental wellness through a time of growth and challenges. </p>
<p>This program teaches youth to pay attention to the unique ways their mental health works, and the ways it can be optimized, including both positive and negative influences on their mental health and wellbeing. By learning about these patterns, participants can be empowered to make healthy decisions to improve their resilience and mental health. </p>
<p>Attendees learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>   what mental health is and how it’s both similar to, and different from, physical health</li>   
<li>   the interaction between brain, body, and life circumstances </li>   
<li>   how to notice the signs of someone needing help</li>   
<li>   tips and strategies for having a caring conversation with someone they are worried about</li>   
<li>   methods of self-care for mind, body, soul, and surroundings</li>   
<li>   how reaching out to a trusted adult can make all the difference</li>   
<li>   examples of resources they can use for support</li>   
</ul>

<p>The program includes brief video narratives from Gen Z influencers, authentically sharing their own experiences with mental health.</p>

<h2>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT</h2>
<h3>Dr. Santhiny Rajamohan</h3>
<h4>New York City Chapter</h4>

<div class="modal-body-copy">

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">What first made you interested in mental health and suicide prevention?  </p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">My interest in helping those with mental health challenges originated when I was working as a Registered Nurse in an inpatient psychiatric unit. I worked with families who struggled to understand the dynamics of their loved ones who were experiencing distress. This taught me the need for greater education and advocacy. When I moved from clinical nursing practice to academia, I had the privilege of teaching mental health nursing to future nurses. We see people in all care settings with mental health needs.</p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">On a personal level, I had experienced a period of hopelessness and helplessness when I first moved to the U.S., after fleeing from my homeland in Sri Lanka due to the civil war. I have also seen students and close friends struggle. Learning about young people ending their own lives in our area in recent years made a deep impression in my heart. I wanted to do something to make a difference. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">How did you first get involved with your local chapter?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I am intentional about incorporating mental health and resiliency into our nursing curriculum. I first reached out to my local AFSP chapter in 2017, because I wanted to bring the Talk Saves Lives program to campus. It was then that I became a volunteer, inspired by the Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate by 20% by 2025. I chaired our first Out of the Darkness Campus Walk, and eventually became a board member, enabling me to focus more on bringing suicide prevention education to our community.</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">How have you used AFSP’s education programs on your campus?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">In addition to being Director of the First-Year Seminar program, I’m also an advisor for the Mental Health Advocate Team (MHAT) on campus, which is a student-led club formed after a few students reached out to me after our first Out of the Darkness Campus Walk. I’ve incorporated both Talk Saves Lives and the It’s Real: College Students and Mental Health film on campus. </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">Through Talk Saves Lives, participants gain insight into why people reach a point where they want to end their lives, and learn the warning signs and how to respond. It naturally leads to conversations about protective factors and building resiliency. I appreciate the research-based curriculum. The program is easy to understand, and the common language used to deliver the content helps make it accessible for participants. </p>
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I use the It’s Real documentary in my student leader training and first-year seminar classes. Learning about real stories of students across the country who thrive in college with mental health challenges is inspiring, and emphasizes the importance of seeking help and utilizing available resources on campus. </p>
</div>


<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">What does the phrase #MentalHealth4All mean to you?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">We are created as holistic beings, meaning we need to have a healthy balance of all the aspects of who we are: physical, spiritual, emotional, mental, and social. I think #MentalHealth4All means that if we neglect our mental health, it will affect our overall well-being, and we lose the ability to live a healthy and happy, balanced life.</p>

<h2>VOLUNTEER SPOTLIGHT</h2>
<h3>Francis Gonzalez</h3>
<h4>Massachusetts Chapter</h4>
</div>

<div class="modal-body-copy">

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">Why is suicide prevention important to you? </p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">I have known people who have attempted suicide – each of them in different periods of my life, but those experiences were unforgettable. My youngest daughter had a friend who made an attempt in middle school, and I realized that having conversations with both my daughters about suicide was important. I wanted to help them cope with what was going on, and also to make sure they felt comfortable talking to me about this subject. But it wasn’t until I first heard about AFSP, through my best friend, that I realized how many people were affected by suicide. I thought to myself, &#8220;What a great opportunity it would be to get involved with my local chapter, educate myself and my daughters, and make a difference in my community.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">What kinds of things do you think about when talking to your daughters about mental health?</p>    
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">When it comes to suicide prevention, education is so important. Being a single parent isn’t easy, but I believe that we as parents must educate ourselves and take care of our own mental health, as we are the lead example for our children. We also need to recognize how society and things like social media have changed from when we were growing up. This generation is dealing with so many different things than what we dealt with, but the important things – and the subjects we may be afraid to talk about – remain the same.</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">How have you been involved in bringing education to your community?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">Mental health and suicide are topics that are not spoken about enough in the Latinx community, though suicide has always impacted us. It’s exciting to me that AFSP’s Talk Saves Lives education program is available in Spanish. The program teaches adults the warning signs, how suicide affects different people due to many different factors, and ways we can all help ourselves and others in the community. The presentation also includes suicide research, and gives people a better understanding of protective factors. Being able to deliver the program in Spanish helps me educate and bring awareness about suicide to the Latinx community and let them know about all the great resources AFSP has available. It’s a great way to make an impact.</p>
</div>

<div class="modalspotlight_section">
<p class="modalspotlight_question">What does the phrase #MentalHealth4All mean to you?</p>   
<p class="modalspotlight_answer">The questions people ask during a Spanish Talk Saves Lives program are very similar to when we do the presentation in English. At heart, people are one and the same. We just speak different languages.</p>
